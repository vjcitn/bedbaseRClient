# Introduction

[bedbase.org]("https://bedbase.org") assembles genomic data on many
thousands of region-based scoring files.  See the [about page for bedbase.org](http://bedbase.org/about)
for details.

This package explores the resource using Bioconductor/R.  We'll use interesting
facilities of the hca package to explore JSON outputs of the bedbase API.

# A basic query

We'll find out about resources related to the GM12878 cell line.

## Metadata acquisition

The `get_bb_metadata` function is very simple.  We'll learn how
to vary the types of data retrieved later on.  One could question
whether 'GM12878' is a 'cell type' and we will examine this concept another time.

```{r lk1}
library(bedbaseRClient)
q1 = get_bb_metadata(query_type="cell_type", query_val="GM12878")
q1
cc = httr::content(q1)
names(cc[[1]][[2]])
```

## Metadata exploration

The content returned by the API is complex.  The hca package can help navigate.

```{r lk2}
library(hca)
lcc = lol(cc) # list of lists
lol_path(lcc)
```

With `lol_pull`, we can extract the content present along a given structural path.

```{r lk3}
exps = lol_pull(lcc, "[*][*].exp_protocol")
table(exps)
```
